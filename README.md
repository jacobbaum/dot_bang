#dot bang - Drum sequencing with Angular.js and Tone.js

##Overview

The dot, bang, and comma in dot bang:

* . - A full stroke. Volume at a medium setting.

* ! - An accent. Volume at a higher setting.

* , - A tap. Volume at a lower setting, with a slightly softer amplitude envelope. 

Comma didn't make it into the app's title.

dot bang is as a project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. The broader intention behind dot bang is to become more familiar Angular, and more comfortable with Javascript in general. Getting to explore Tone.js is a big bonus.

##User Stories:
The Trello board for dot bang can be found at [https://trello.com/b/EKPTQK1l/dot-bang-angular-js-drum-machine](http://). As of initial deployment, three out of 22 have been completed:

As a user I want to...

* Control tempo.
* Use multiple time signatures.
* Save beats I created.

Going forward, stories related to sharing beats and changing musical setting will have priority.

##Technologies Used

Principle Technologies:

* Angular.js - Front end
* Tone.js - Audio

##Next Steps

Coming soon:
